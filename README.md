# Student Portal
In this project, we plan to develop a student portal that manages student data, course details, and course registrations. Key features of the portal include:

- Adding and removing students and courses.
- Searching and viewing student and course information.
- Enrolling students in courses, withdrawing them, and recording grades.
- Displaying lists of students, courses, and enrolled studentsâ€™ grades for specific or all courses.
